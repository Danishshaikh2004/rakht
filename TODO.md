## üîß Key Implementation Details

### Registration Flow:
1. User fills registration form (3 steps with OTP verification)
2. **NEW:** User sets password and confirms it in step 1
3. On final step, `AuthService.registerUser()` is called with:
   - Email and user-provided password
   - All user data (name, phone, blood group, location, etc.)
4. User data saved to Firebase Auth + Firestore database
5. Success message shown
6. User redirected to login page

### Login Flow:
1. User enters email and password (or uses Google Sign-In)
2. `AuthService.loginUser()` authenticates with Firebase
3. On success, user redirected to home page
4. On failure, error message displayed

### Google Sign-In Flow:
1. User clicks "Continue with Google" button
2. `AuthService.signInWithGoogle()` handles OAuth flow
3. User account created/accessed in Firebase Auth
4. User redirected to home page
5. Loading states and error handling included

### Database Storage:
- User authentication data stored in Firebase Auth
- User profile data stored in Firestore 'users' collection
- Includes: uid, email, displayName, phone, bloodGroup, location, lastDonation, registrationDate, etc.
- Google Sign-In users get additional profile data from Google account

## üß™ Testing Required

### Critical Path Testing:
- [ ] Complete registration flow with password fields (3 steps + OTP)
- [ ] Registration ‚Üí Login page redirect
- [ ] Login with registered credentials (email + password)
- [ ] Login ‚Üí Home page redirect
- [ ] Google Sign-In flow
- [ ] Firebase database verification (check if user data saved)

### Error Scenarios:
- [ ] Invalid email format during registration
- [ ] Existing email registration attempt
- [ ] Invalid login credentials
- [ ] Network connectivity issues

### Edge Cases:
- [ ] OTP verification timeout
- [ ] Multiple registration attempts
- [ ] Browser refresh during registration
- [ ] Long form data (special characters, etc.)

### Home Page Authentication Testing:
- [ ] Home page shows login/register buttons for non-authenticated users
- [ ] Home page shows donate/request buttons for authenticated users
- [ ] Different welcome messages for logged in vs non-logged in users
- [ ] Authentication state changes properly update home page content

### Donation Form Testing:
- [ ] Authentication check - redirects to login if not authenticated
- [ ] Form pre-population with user profile data
- [ ] Form validation (all required fields)
- [ ] Successful donation submission saves to Firebase
- [ ] Error handling for failed submissions
- [ ] Form reset after successful submission

### Blood Request Form Testing:
- [ ] Authentication check - redirects to login if not authenticated
- [ ] Form pre-population with user profile data
- [ ] Form validation (all required fields)
- [ ] File upload functionality (prescription, hospital report)
- [ ] Urgency level selection
- [ ] Successful request submission saves to Firebase
- [ ] Error handling for failed submissions
- [ ] Form reset after successful submission

### Firebase Database Testing:
- [ ] Verify donation data saved to 'donations' collection
- [ ] Verify blood request data saved to 'blood_requests' collection
- [ ] Verify user profile updates in 'users' collection
- [ ] Check data structure and field mapping

## üìù Notes

- Temporary password 'tempPassword123' used for registration (users will login with email only)
- Email verification is sent during registration but not enforced for login
- User profile data is automatically loaded after successful authentication
- All authentication state is managed through AuthContext
